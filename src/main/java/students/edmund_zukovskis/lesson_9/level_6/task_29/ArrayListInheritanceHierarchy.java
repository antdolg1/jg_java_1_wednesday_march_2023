ArrayList is inherited from the AbstractList class, which, in turn, is inherited from the class
AbstractCollection. AbstractList and AbstractCollection implement the core functionality
interfaces List and Collection respectively. The abstract class AbstractList implements some
methods, providing a common implementation for methods that do not depend on a particular implementation of the collection.
AbstractCollection also contains an implementation of some methods of the Collection interface,
implementation-independent. Finally, the Object class is the root class for all
Java classes, including ArrayList.
